Since Secure Multi-Party Computation only works on integers, in order to operate over numbers with decimal points (such as weights and activations), we need to encode all of our numbers using Fixed Precision, which will give us several bits of decimal precision.

Therefore, we need to add a special AutogradTensor node that computes the gradient graph for backpropagation. You can print any of this element to see that it includes an AutogradTensor."
